# Reddit -- Understanding the users from polarized online social communities

In human society, people form communities based on shared values, interests, or social practices. This social behavior has also become routine in the online community. For example, subreddits can be viewed as such communities, where people with the same interest can talk to each other under the corresponding subreddit.

The boundaries between online communities can be flexible or rigid. On one hand, people interested in **r/iphone** may be also interested in, say **r/macbook**. On the other hand, some subreddits are so special that users have a "belong-to" or "not-belong-to" feeling. A casual example would be, say, **r/PS4** and **r/xboxone**, where people owning different types of consoles would form different online communities. A more serious example would be, for example, **r/MensRights** and **r/Feminism**, which represent two large polarized communities on Reddit, so people have a strong sense of belonging and tend to antagonize users from the other community. 

In this data science project, I tried to understand the users of **r/MensRights** and **r/Feminism** from different perspective. Some of the questions to be addressed are as follows:

1. Do users have biased choice between **r/MensRights** and **r/Feminism**?
2. What are the most salient linguistic features that distinguish posts in **r/MensRights** from those in **r/Feminism**?
3. How does users' linguistic pattern change over time ?

Below are the highlights of some interesting and non-trivial findings
